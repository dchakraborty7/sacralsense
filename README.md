# SacralSense
An I-CUra Tech Repository Outlining SacralSense


Welcome to SacralSense! SacralSense is an integrated sensor dressing that connects to a user interface.
In this repository, you will find information about the clinical problem SacralSense addresses, details about what the hardware and firmware do, specifications of our hydrofoam based dressing, and a codebase for the backend & frontend software operating within the GUI. SacralSense is an I-CUra Tech patented product.

**[ICU] Team: I-CUra Tech  Team Members:** Jennifer Arkin, Dipro Chakraborty, Cristina Ibanez, Ben Myers, Shraddha Patel, and Jaclyn Sider  **Clinical Mentor:** Maxwell Weinmann, M.D.

**Project Description:** In the U.S., 2.5 million ICU patients develop pressure ulcers costing more than $15 billion a year. The I-CUra team developed SacralSense, a pressure ulcer preventative hydrofoam dressing that redistributes pressure across the sacrum and measures interface pressure and bioimpedance ICU patients. The SacralSense system is designed as a stand-alone technology to replace current sacral hydrofoam dressings, worn by the majority of ICU patients, for prevention of pressure ulcer onset and progression on the sacrum. Nurses will apply and monitor the device, which will provide a more quantifiable prevention tool than current sacral hydrofoam dressings that only redistribute pressure. SacralSense also consists of a user interface (UI) that alerts nurses when a patientâ€™s pressure or bioimpedance levels are out of normal range. This will alert the nurse that further preventative measures are needed to prevent onset or progression of a pressure ulcer on the sacrum. The UI will also hold patient information, including current preventative measures and treatments applied, relevant medical information, and trends of pressure and bioimpedance readings over time. The system improves patient quality of life, reduces length of stay, and reduces healthcare costs for both patients and hospitals.
