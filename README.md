An I-CUra Tech Repository Outlining SacralSense


Welcome to SacralSense! SacralSense is an integrated sensor dressing that connects to a user interface.
In this repository, you will find information about the clinical problem SacralSense addresses, details about what the hardware
and firmware do, specifications of our hydrofoam based dressing, and a codebase for the backend & frontend software operating 
within the GUI.
